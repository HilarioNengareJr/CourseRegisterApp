## XAMPP

1. Download and install XAMPP: Go to the Apache Friends website (https://www.apachefriends.org/) and download the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

2. Start XAMPP: Once the installation is complete, open XAMPP control panel. On Windows, you can find it in the XAMPP installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp). On macOS, you can find it in the "Applications" folder. Linux users can start XAMPP from the terminal using the command `sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start`.

3. Start Apache and MySQL: In the XAMPP control panel, click on the "Start" button next to Apache and MySQL. This will start the Apache web server and the MySQL database server.

4. Test the installation: Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost` in the address bar. You should see the XAMPP welcome page, indicating that Apache is running correctly.

5. Place the cloned CourseRegisterApp folder: By default, XAMPP serves files from the `htdocs` directory. On Windows, this directory is located in the XAMPP installation folder (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs). On macOS, it is located at /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs, and on Linux, it is located at /opt/lampp/htdocs. Place your PHP files inside this directory.
